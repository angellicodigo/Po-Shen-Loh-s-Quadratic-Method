Task: Mathematican Po-Shen Loh found a method to solve the quadratic equation without using the quadratic formula. I wanted to create a Python algorithm that simulates the method. This both teaches me what are the steps and whether or not his method is true for both real and imagery solutions.<br>

This quadratic formula solver using Po-Shen Loh method shows step-by-step for solving and works for imaginery solutions.

# For example

**x^2 + 4x + 5**
