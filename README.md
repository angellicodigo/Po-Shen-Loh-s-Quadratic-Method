<h1>Po-Shen Loh's Method for Solving the Quadratic Method</h1>
Task: Mathematican Po-Shen Loh found a method to solve the quadratic equation without using the quadratic formula. I wanted to create a Python algorithm that simulates the method. This both teaches me what are the steps and whether or not his method is true for both real and imagery solutions.<br>

This quadratic formula solver using Po-Shen Loh method shows step-by-step for solving and works for imaginery solutions.

# For example

Lets say we are solving **x^2 + 4x + 5**

```
Given: (ax^2 + bx^2 + c)
Solve: (-B/2 + z)(-B/2 - z) = C as B = b/a and C = c/a

Enter the number for a: 1
Enter the number for b: 4
Enter the number for c: 5

Solving for: (1.0)x^2+(4.0)x+(5.0)
(-2 + z)(-2 - z) = 5
(-2)^2 - (z)^2 = 5
4 - z^2 = 5
-z^2 = 5 - 4
√(z)^2 = √(-1)
z = 1j
x = -2 + 1j, x = -2 - 1j
```
