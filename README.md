<h1>Personal Project</h1>
Task: Mathematican Po-Shen Loh found a method to solve the quadratic equation without using the quadratic formula. I wanted to create a Python algorithm that simulates the method. This both teaches me what are the steps and whether or not his method is true for both real and imagery solutions.<br>
